## About

The code is a Python word game that uses the Ursina game engine to generate a 4x4 grid of cubes with random alphabet letters. Players input words using an input field and submit them to the game. The game checks if the word is valid (at least 3 letters long and exists in the English dictionary), and if it is, the player earns points based on the word's length and letter scores. The game includes a timer, points counter, grid of cubes, input field, submit button, and word validation and scoring logic. The game continues until the time limit is reached, and players aim to maximize their score by forming valid words using the available letters.

# Ratting

The game has a clear objective, a timer, and rewards points based on word length. It uses tooltips for word definitions and feedback. The graphical interface is simple. However, it could benefit from better organization, modularization, clearer variable names, improved error handling, and clearer feedback. It also lacks sound effects or music, and could benefit from more appealing graphics and animations.
